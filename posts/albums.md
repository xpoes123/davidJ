# Top 5 Influential Albums

**Date:** December 12th, 2025

## Preamble

Every year Spotify Wrapped rolls around and I get nostalgic about all the good music I've listened throughout my life. Whether it be the song that I had forgotten I listened to that year, or me going through my old playlists and seeing what type of music I enjoyed in middle school.

We live in a world full of data, and although data is great, it doesn't always paint the full picture of where we stand emotionally. I may have listened to [Brr Brr Patapim Funk](https://youtu.be/7C1g028A0DA?si=j2vsslpI1EFYD8mW) 41 times, but it doesn't mean I have any emotional connection to the song itself.

In a world where AI is taking over, it's often important to slow down and remember what makes humans special. It's the fact that we don't necessarily need data to make our choices and form our emotions.

## Why Albums

Several people I know aren't super big fans of albums. When I was younger I always viewed albums as being more pretentious than songs themselves. It didn't make sense to me to like all 12 songs when some of them were just bad. I found myself often getting bored of the same artist playing over and over.

But as I grew older I shifted my viewpoint away from music as being music, but rather music as being art: a story being told through the tracks that the artist prepared to convey a variety of emotions and ideas. Ok, I don't have anything actually profound to say. This is just me saying **albums > songs**.

## Honorable Mentions

These are albums that came close. In reality, this is basically my top seven, but the distinction matters: the top five are albums that are inseparable from specific moments in my life. These honorable mentions almost get there.

### _Small Talk_ — **Copeland James**

I discovered _Small Talk_ while flipping through the “local” section of an underground (literally underground) record shop in Bloomington, Indiana. This was around the time I had started getting into local music and house shows in Madison, so I was immediately drawn to it. I didn’t know the artist, but the cover art alone convinced me it was something I’d like, which, in hindsight, is an insane way to make purchasing decisions, but it worked.

I bought it, listened to it nonstop for days, and eventually realized I had to see it live while I was still in Indiana. I reached out to Copeland James, caught them at a random bar show, and later through my involvement with WUD Music I ended up booking them in Madison multiple times over the next couple of years. Every show was a blast.

This album doesn’t quite crack the top five because it isn’t tied to one singular emotional turning point, but it represents discovery, community, and one of the moments where music started bleeding into the rest of my life.

### _On Hold_ — **Fenne Lily**

_On Hold_ found me through the Spotify algorithm at exactly the wrong (or right) time. I had been binge-listening to Keaton Henson, which was my first real introduction to sad, quiet, introspective music.

I remember it vividly: around 2am, under the covers, scrolling for new music. The first time I heard “Car Park,” I cried. Immediately. No build-up. No warning.

I fell in love with Fenne Lily and _On Hold_ right away. Musically, this album is incredible — honestly, if I were ranking purely on sound, it might be higher. But the albums in the top five are tied to moments that feel heavier and more defining. _On Hold_ is deeply emotional, but it feels more like a chapter than a turning point.

## The Top 5

### 5) _xInfinity_ — **Watsky**

Ok I lied — I said that the top 5 are super emotional and tied to chapters of my life. And to some sense this is a chapter, but not fully. There aren’t many heavy emotions tied to this album — it’s just a really good album.

Many people consider _xInfinity_ Watsky’s magnum opus, and I agree. The storytelling is strong, the production is polished, and the technical rapping is excellent. Watsky was the first artist I was truly a fan of; I listened to _Cardboard Castles_ religiously before this album came out.

More importantly, this album coincides with the first concert I ever went to. In that sense, _xInfinity_ kickstarted my entire concert going life, which has since become a pretty significant part of who I am. It’s not the most emotionally intense album here — but it’s foundational.

### 4) _Twenty One Pilots_

This album is emotionally heavy for reasons that have very little to do with the music itself.

My best friend committed suicide. Before that, we were preparing to play “Migraine” (from _Vessel_) for a talent show — a song that explicitly touches on suicidal thoughts. A few months later, he was gone.

I have strong memories of sitting in his basement, listening to the self-titled album, dissecting lyrics that probably didn’t mean much to us at the time. Now, some of these songs are difficult to listen to without tearing up.

This album evokes some of the strongest emotions on this list, but it sits at #4 because it was never my favorite musically. Its importance comes from memory and loss — not preference.

### 3) _No Dogs Allowed_ — **Sidney Gish**

![No Dogs Allowed](img/blogs/albums/resized_128/no_dogs_allowed.jpg)

This album was recommended to me during a summer internship in Indiana. The funny part is that the person who recommended it hesitated — she assumed there was no way I hadn’t already heard of Sidney Gish.

I hadn’t.

When I finally listened, it felt oddly perfect for where I was in life. I was in a rough patch with my girlfriend at the time, and the album hit this strange balance: upbeat, playful, but lyrically sharp in a way that felt uncomfortably accurate. Sidney was just an awkward 20 year old going through life seeing life in a way that felt uncanny to me.

I later saw Sidney Gish live in New York, opening for Katy Kirby, performing under the name Zelda Van Gutters. It was an intimate show, and her personality — playful, warm, and genuinely funny — made the music feel even more personal. This album represents a moment where music didn’t just reflect my emotions, it understood them.

### 2) _Birthdays / Dear_ — **Keaton Henson**

![Birthdays/Dear](img/blogs/albums/resized_128/birthdays.jpg)

This was the first album that truly got me into music.

I originally found it through the soundtrack for _A Brilliant Young Mind_ (_X+Y_), but it quickly became associated with Griffin, who was the aforementioned friend who took his life. The emotional connection was so strong that I stopped listening to Keaton Henson entirely for several years because it was just too much.

I feel obligated to mention the song “Metaphors,” which I don't want to get into too much here, but if you know you know. Recently, his album _Parade_ pulled me back in, and I’ve found myself reconnecting with his music in a healthier way.

Looking back, this album played a huge role in shaping my taste. Before it, I mostly listened to mainstream rap and pop. After it, everything changed.

### 1) _Punisher_ — **Phoebe Bridgers**

![Punisher](img/blogs/albums/resized_128/punisher.png)

This is the album I associate most strongly with a specific era of my life.

I played _Punisher_ endlessly during COVID. When I listen to it now, I get vivid flashbacks to that time — senior year of high school, isolation, uncertainty, and this strange mix of deep sadness and quiet happiness.

Naomi introduced me to this album, and it felt like a gateway into the type of music I eventually fell in love with. Songs like “Kyoto” and “Garden Song” still hit hard. “Garden Song,” especially, reminds me of seeing Phoebe live when the opening of the song mirrored the opening of the book she read on stage. Hearing her perform “That Funny Feeling” live genuinely made me cry.

This album feels like a phylogenetic split in my music taste — everything after it traces back to here. Every year I return to _Punisher_ and find new meaning in it, shaped by wherever I am in life at the time. As a sophomore album, it speaks volumes about Phoebe Bridgers’ depth as an artist and her ability to provoke introspection.

This one isn’t just influential. It’s permanent.
