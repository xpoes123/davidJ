# Top 5 Influential Albums

**Date:** December 12th, 2025

## Preamble

Every year Spotify Wrapped rolls around and I get nostalgic about all the good music I've listened throughout my life. Whether it be the song that I had forgotten I listened to that year, or me going through my old playlists and seeing what type of music I enjoyed in middle school.

We live in a world full of data, and although data is great, it doesn't always paint the full picture of where we stand emotionally. I may have listened to [Brr Brr Patapim Funk](https://youtu.be/7C1g028A0DA?si=j2vsslpI1EFYD8mW) 41 times, but it doesn't mean I have any emotional connection to the song itself.

In a world where AI is taking over, it's often important to slow down and remember what makes humans special. It's the fact that we don't necessarily need data to make our choices and form our emotions.

## Why Albums

Several people I know aren't super big fans of albums. When I was younger I always viewed albums as being more pretentious than songs themselves. It didn't make sense to me to like all 12 songs when some of them were just bad. I found myself often getting bored of the same artist playing over and over.

But as I grew older I shifted my viewpoint away from music as being music, but rather music as being art: a story being told through the tracks that the artist prepared to convey a variety of emotions and ideas. Ok, I don't have anything actually profound to say. This is just me saying **albums > songs**.
