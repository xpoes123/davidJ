# College Retrospective

**Date:** May 26, 2025

## High School vs. College

College isn’t mandatory—it’s an **investment**. Unlike high school, where attendance is compulsory, college asks you to stake both your time and your money on an uncertain future. People spend **hundreds of thousands** of dollars chasing a degree, and yet at 18 we’re expected to pick our path.

In reality, most of us experiment first. I declared chemistry, then switched into software engineering, flirted with quant, then shifted to oure math. That trial‑and‑error comes at a cost, but it also reveals what truly fits. For me, math’s elegance was irresistible… until I hit the roadblocks that showed me loving a subject doesn’t guarantee it’ll love you back.

## Skipping Out on Math

A year ago, I was convinced academia was my path. I’d always liked math and, more importantly, envisioned eventually earning a PhD. The **driving force** was my love of learning: math is a boundless subject that deepens the more you explore. Yet I don’t regret abandoning that path.

> “Everything is viewed through rose-tinted glasses when you don’t know the other perspective.”

Even if I’d tried to climb that mountain, success was never guaranteed. Below are the main reasons I ultimately quit:

### 1. People Are Too Smart

Every mathematician hits a roadblock at some point—Algebra I for some; Calculus for many; for me, **Abstract Algebra 2** (Math 542 at UW–Madison). This class was taught by Paul Apisa, a notorious professor at UW known for being a great lecturer, but gave out impossibly difficult homeworks and exams. People often ask what the point of taking such a class is. It just sounds like being a masochist, but like what my roommate always says, enjoying math is masochistic in it of itself. Classes like these are ideal for becoming a research mathematician. The homeworks were sort of expositions into adjacent topics that applied the basic concepts you learned in class. Essentially an abridged version of how you might've discovered the underlying math yourself

I caught **COVID** in week 4—just as we were covering _tensor products_. Missing that week left me completely lost. I spent countless hours:

1. Reading the textbook
2. Reviewing notes
3. Watching online lectures

…and still fell behind. Not only did none of it stick, the class, and my other classes continued to progress leaving me in the dust. The first midterm comes around and I scored below the third quartile. This was the worst I've done on an exam relative to the class. I had known that I did poorly on the exam, just because in math it's so easy to self report your understanding of the content. However, when the grades were released, even though I was enjoying myself at a Halloween party, I still felt heartbroken.

Such a common trope in undergraduate is that one class doesn't matter and everyone struggles. I quite honestly strongly disagree with this sentiment. How can I tell myself I can be a mathematician if I was struggling so much in an undergraduate class in a mid tier university. Sure the class was difficult and I had set backs, but it was eye opening in the sense that I could no longer coast my way through good grades. I did end up locking in and scored above average on the final, I still realized that this was a bad sign for my math aptitude.

### 2. Research Bureaucracy

My junior year summer I did an REU at UW-Madison on _Latent Network Learning_. In an abstract sense we were decomposing certain networks into their building blocks and reconstructing other networks. The project was interesting. But it wasn't really the research that caused me issues. The real issue that I had was how poorly the program was ran. My experience at my previous research experience in Indiana University was wonderful. Everything was ran very well and we were treated very well. **THIS WAS NOT THE NORM**.

Research internships aren't meant to be considered a j\*b. Afterall, the money you make isn't even taxed since it's considered a stipend. But at the same time, many of these programs stipulate that you are not allowed to work a job concurrently. The program paid around $4,000 over 10 weeks, which is reasonable to live off of as a college student. However, what ended up happening was we never got paid.

The first two weeks had gone by and I contacted the professors regarding payment as it was customary to be paid... I was told that money would be coming shortly. Two more weeks go by and again I follow up asking for an update, and again I'm told that I would be paid on the pay cycle. **Again**, two more weeks go by and we're halfway through the project while a single cent hasn't touched my checkings. I had money at the time and I wasn't super concerned about not having enough money, but there was a distinct lack of urgency and a feeling of disrespect. And after spending 6-8 hours a day working on a reserach project, I felt I deserved something in return.

Around the 8 week mark of the program I hit a massive down swing in poker. This included several large losses and me accidentally losing $2,000 by sending it to the wrong person. I had enough money in my poker budget to cover all of this, but since we weren't getting paid for the research position, I had to transfer money from my poker account to my everyday account. In the month of August I had probably burned through around 8k from poker losses and general living expenses for the past 3 months since I wasn't paid. This was no longer feasible. I started getting upset at the professor and HR, neither of which gave me a good reason as to why payment was delayed and when I would get paid. It wasn't until three days before the program had concluded had I finally gotten a check.

This whole experience left a very sour taste in my mouth. The pay was already not good to start with along with horrendous amenities. There was no incentive to want to pursue academia. These summer programs are meant to shed a light on academia and preparing students for PhDs. All it had done was actively disuade me from pursuing a PhD.

If the university cared this little about paying for research, why should I provide such a service to the university. Even beyond just the disrespect, I don't want to have to grovel at the feet of HR just to get my tiny stipend. My work should be paid for adequately and timely. Am I being a brat? I don't think so, I think these are just terms that should be agreed upon.

## Final Thoughts

When I asked professors whether to pursue academia, many actively **dissuaded** me. Although I departed early and can’t speak to the later years, however, here’s my take on a math PhD financially, and the biggest reason as to why I quit:

- **Compensation:**
  - ≈ \$35 K/year, 40+ hours/week
  - No retirement benefits, unstable job prospects
- **5-year total & benefits comparison:**

  | Path                     | 5-years   | Key benefits                                 |
  | ------------------------ | --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
  | **Math PhD**             | ≈ \$175 K | Doctor title, deeper math expertise          |
  | **Software Engineering** | ≈ \$600 K | 401(k) match, HSA, Roth IRA, stronger credit |

Of course, a PhD isn’t inherently “bad,” but in my case, I believe it **contradicted** the idea that college is an investment in my future.
